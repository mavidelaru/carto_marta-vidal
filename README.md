# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

It puts modules in place so that node can find them.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

## ðŸ“‚ About files structure
As known, React does not have a mandatory structure on how to put files into folders. So I decided to structure it as: components | services | pages | style . I left the App component aside, as itâ€™s the main component where everything is initiate.

In the general style folder you can find main css sheets. In this case I grouped styles with tsx components, cause it's easier for me to work with the files. In a big project the best practice would be separete the styles components to other folders. Also, in case of big projects the icons would be better display using a library as iconMoon (where you can use your own icons).

## ðŸ“± About the project
I choose to create the components as React Functional Components.

I tried to use diferents methodologies to create the components. For example, Tab component is created from diferents smallers components. Button componens, you can see how would be generated dinaminacly... etc.

I used some Hooks but I center the assignment on the UI part.
